        \subsection{Basic Idea}
            This paper summarizes an approach to synthesizing decision trees that have been used in a variety of systems, and puposed the ID3 system in detail. ID3 can be modified to deal with information that is noisy and/or incomplete. A reported shortcoming of the algorithm is also discussed.
